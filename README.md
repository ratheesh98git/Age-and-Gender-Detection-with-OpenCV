Explore the fascinating world of facial attribute recognition with this project! Detect faces, predict age groups, and determine gender from images or live video using powerful deep learning models and OpenCV.

🚀 Key Features:
Face Detection: Identify faces with precision using the MobileNet SSD model.
Gender Classification: Predict whether faces are Male or Female using a trained Caffe model.
Age Estimation: Estimate age brackets (e.g., (0 - 2), (4 - 6), ..., (60 - 100)) with another pre-trained Caffe model.
Visual Feedback: See detected faces highlighted with bounding boxes and annotated with their predicted age and gender.
Versatile Application: Perfect for security systems, demographic analysis, and more!
🛠️ Technologies Used:
OpenCV: Harness the power of OpenCV's DNN module for efficient deep learning integration.
Python: Scripting language of choice for flexibility and ease of development.
📝 How to Use:
Setup: Install OpenCV (pip install opencv-python).
Models: Download the necessary pre-trained models.
Run: Execute the Python script with your images or video feed to witness real-time age and gender predictions.
🌐 Example Applications:
Security Enhancement: Automatically profile individuals based on age and gender in surveillance systems.
Marketing Insights: Optimize targeted advertising campaigns with demographic data extracted from customer images.
